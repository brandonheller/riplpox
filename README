== Running RipL on POX with Mininet ==

RipL-POX must use the exact same topology as Mininet.  Order shouldn't matter, but to reduce the initial debug output caused by IPv6 link-layer discovery messages that get broadcast, start up the topology first:

# Running Mininet w/a Fat Tree topology, in a second window:
cd ~/
sudo mn --custom ~/ripl/ripl/mn.py --topo ft,4 --controller=remote --mac

# Run POX in reactive mode (one option)
cd ~/
~/pox/pox.py riplpox.riplpox --topo=ft,4 --routing=random --mode=reactive

== Verifying the setup ==

In mininet console:
pingall
iperf
